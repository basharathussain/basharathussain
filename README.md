# Hi, I'm Basharat Hussain

I received a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from COMSATS University Islamabad, Pakistan, and hold an M.S. in Computer Science from the International Islamic University (IIUI), Islamabad. 
I’m a research scientist and AI/ML developer passionate about building intelligent systems that work effectively in the real world. 
With over 23 years of professional experience, I have developed and architected enterprise-grade software solutions for multinational companies in Europe and the USA, specializing in software design, architecture, and development using C++, C#, ASP.NET Core, Java, HTML, and Python.

Currently, I’m an **Assistant Professor** in the Faculty of Computing at the National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences (FAST), Islamabad. My research interests are in “intelligent transportation systems", "autonomous vehicles" and "large language models” including data modeling, simulation, stability, and control in the domains of smart travel and generative models. In addition, he performs research on the application of software technologies, cloud computing, IoT, federated learning and machine learning for design and operation research systems.


My focus areas include **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **Computer Vision**, and **efficient model training and deployment** with a strong eye on **fairness** and **scalability**. I combine strong research foundations with hands-on experience in deploying models and pipelines across academic and industrial settings.

, where he leads research in deep learning, large language models (LLMs), motion diffusion, multimodal AI, and federated learning. His research further explores Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LoRA-based model fine-tuning, and the integration of Vector Databases for advanced AI pipelines.


## 💻 What I Do

🧠 **LLMs & NLP Systems**  
I fine-tune Large Language Models (like LLaMA) and build intelligent systems that actually understand context. From retrieval-augmented generation to semantic search, I help machines read between the lines—sometimes better than people do.

🤖 **Agentic AI & Multi-Agent Systems**  
I design intelligent agents that can plan, collaborate, and execute complex tasks—autonomously. Using frameworks like LangGraph and LangChain, I’ve built multi-agent LLM systems that coordinate workflows and dynamically retrieve and reason over knowledge.

⚖️ **Bias & Fairness in AI**  
I analyze how efficient training methods (like pruning or distillation) affect model behavior and fairness. My work bridges the gap between performance and ethics—because faster models shouldn't mean unfair ones.

⚡ **Efficient Deep Learning**  
SparseGPT? Wanda? LoRA? Been there, benchmarked that. I use these tools to reduce compute while keeping models sharp and responsible.

👁️ **Computer Vision**  
From newborn MRI segmentation to real-time traffic surveillance, I apply deep learning where precision matters. I've worked with U-Nets, YOLOv5, and domain adaptation techniques to make CV models useful in real-world, high-stakes applications.

☁️ **Cloud & MLOps**  
Azure, AWS, Docker, CI/CD—you name it. I make sure ML models don’t just train well but run well, scale well, and behave themselves in production environments.
