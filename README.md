# Hi, I'm Basharat Hussain

I received a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from COMSATS University Islamabad, Pakistan, and hold an M.S. in Computer Science from the International Islamic University (IIUI), Islamabad. 
I’m a research scientist and AI/ML developer passionate about building intelligent systems that work effectively in the real world. 
With over 23 years of professional experience, I have developed and architected enterprise-grade software solutions for multinational companies in Europe and the USA, specializing in software design, architecture, and development using C++, C#, ASP.NET Core, Java, HTML, and Python.

Currently, I’m an **Assistant Professor** in the Faculty of Computing at the National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences (FAST), Islamabad. My research interests are in “**intelligent transportation systems**", "**autonomous vehicles**", and "**large language models**”. My focus areas include **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **Computer Vision**, and **efficient model training and deployment**, **LoRA-based model fine-tuning**, **AgenticAI** with a strong eye on **fairness** and **scalability**. I combine strong research foundations with hands-on experience in deploying models and pipelines across academic and industrial settings.
 
## 💻 What I Do

🧠 **LLMs & NLP Systems**  
I fine-tune Large Language Models (like LLaMA) and build intelligent systems that actually understand context. From retrieval-augmented generation to semantic search, I help machines read between the lines—sometimes better than people do.

🤖 **Agentic AI & Multi-Agent Systems**  
I design intelligent agents that can plan, collaborate, and execute complex tasks—autonomously. Using frameworks like LangGraph and LangChain, I’ve built multi-agent LLM systems that coordinate workflows and dynamically retrieve and reason over knowledge.

🤖 **Motion Perception & Autonomous Vehicles**  
This is my research area; I have published various research articles in this area.  

⚖️ **Bias & Fairness in AI**  
I analyze how efficient training methods (like pruning or distillation) affect model behavior and fairness. My work bridges the gap between performance and ethics—because faster models shouldn't mean unfair ones.

⚡ **Efficient Deep Learning**  
SparseGPT? Wanda? LoRA? Been there, benchmarked that. I use these tools to reduce compute while keeping models sharp and responsible.

👁️ **Computer Vision**  
From newborn MRI segmentation to real-time traffic surveillance, I apply deep learning where precision matters. I've worked with U-Nets, YOLOv5, and domain adaptation techniques to make CV models useful in real-world, high-stakes applications.

☁️ **Cloud & MLOps**  
Azure, AWS, Docker, CI/CD. I make sure ML models don’t just train well but run well, scale well, and behave themselves in production environments.
